# SystemRepair

Your Windows version is completely destroyed and you don't know what to do and don't know what is powershell?

Well don't worry since we got SystemRepair!

Probably the most scuffed repair utility written in you guessed it. Batch.

But it works so I don't care, give it a try!

Automatically recgonizes your windows version starting from vista and gives you 2 lines of information about your system!

#### Don't be a noob, go to the releases tab.

If you are one, then heres a hyperlink i guess.

# What now?

Well that's pretty much it. 

You have some shortcuts and that stuff.

Just download the utility.

Run it as admin (or else you will be forced to)

And enjoy this crappy thing.

# Every program shortcut is ripped directly from MSConfig

Like what did you expect?

# Conclusion

Cool program
