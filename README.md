# SystemRepair


Youre Windows version is completely fucked and you dont know what to do and dont know what the fuck is powershell?

Well dont worry no more since we got SystemRepair!

Probably the most scuffed repair utility written in you guessed it. Batch.

But like it works so idk give it a try


Automatically recgonizes windows version starting from vista and gives you 2 lines of information about youre system!

# Yea please dont repost this

Like seriously i worked a SHIT ton on this.

Dont repost a unmodified version of SystemRepair.


Just please.

# And what now?

Well thats pretty much it. 

You have some program shortcuts and that stuff.

Just download the utility.


Run it as admin (Or else you will be forced to lmao)

And yea enjoy this crappy thing.

# Every program shortcut ripped directly off from MSConfig


Like what did you expect?
